# Web-Development
This repository shows the practice of my web development journey from scratch.
This codes are simple beginner's code. I am learning consistently. I just uploaded 57 folders on 28.05.24, all together, which I have been learning for quite some time now.
I am learning consistently and hope to learn Web Development as fast as I can.
